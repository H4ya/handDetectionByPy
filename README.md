# handDetectionByPy
Hello, I'm in my summer break so I decided to kill myself by starting a new project in the AI field with 0.000% knowledge! Wish me luck!!


I just got an idea, will start recording my changes here!

- started using "lary" (a very terrible short name for landmark array\)
- optimized the if statements for showing the points' coordinates (start using mathematical logic instead of multiple ORs)
- rounded the z values for clear visualization
