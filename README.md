# handDetectionByPy
Hello, I'm in my summer break so I decided to kill myself by starting a new project in the AI field with 0.000% knowledge! Wish me luck!!


I just got an idea, will start recording my changes here!
6/16/2025 5:37:

- started using "lary" (a very terrible short name for landmark array\)
- optimized the if statements for showing the points' coordinates (start using mathematical logic instead of multiple ORs)
- rounded the z values for clear visualization

13:24
- added a thumbs up detector (without youtube)
- start  using the range function, can't believe I forgot about it! life is easier now
- messed up a little with the thumbs up and ok if statements(I was trying to optimize it using range), will fix it later

18:05
- add distinguishing right 1\left 0 hands and added it as a forth dimension in lary

22:28
- deleted unnecessary comments\code
- fixed the thumb up state to contain right\left thumbs
- added a range for the thumbs to be acceptable (-60,60)
I'm proud and sleepy

6/20/2025 1:50 :
- I added if statement to check the space between 4 and 5
- I missed up something in the lines 80-87 

7/02/2025 23:05 :
- Trying to add a sound control feature cuz it looks cool
- (one hour later) I did it it is really cool!!!
